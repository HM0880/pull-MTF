To-do list
*******************************************************************************

.. todolist::

+ Display min overlapping corridor in microns
- Option for saving the data to an external file
- "No data!" error

+ Use os.path
+ Document this with .rst as practice
+ Option for plotting all the plots on the same figure
  * It would be nice to have a legend too...
* It would be really awesome to have an output that tells the defocus range
  (in microns) where the corridors overlap
- Work on making the GUI launch faster
    * does selectively importing modules help this?
    * (and would it make the GUI file size smaller???)

- How to input desired freqs???
    * list or array???
